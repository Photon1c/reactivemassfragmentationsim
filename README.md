# üçâ RMF: Melon Protocol  
*Splatter Engine for Soft-Body Rupture Dynamics*

This all is now live [here](https://rmfmelonprotocol.netlify.app/).

![sample](media/sample.gif)

Three.js simulator of rigid and soft body physics using simple melon and ball as base templates.

## What is RMF?

<b>RMF stands for <i>Reactive Mass Fragmentation</i></b>.

It refers to the simulated physics behavior of soft-bodied organic matter (like a melon) breaking apart under high-velocity impact ‚Äî capturing the reactivity, mass inertia, and fragmentation dynamics of the rupture. This simulation models how force propagates through and destroys squishy matter in real-time.

## Features

- ‚úÖ Realistic impact physics (Cannon.js)
- ‚úÖ Threshold-based rupture logic
- ‚úÖ Modular projectile system
- ‚úÖ Procedural splatter burst (THREE.js)
- ‚úÖ Scaled splatter based on impact speed
- ‚úÖ Fully procedural watermelon with realistic skin, rind, and flesh
- ‚úÖ Fragments and seeds with robust physics, always accumulate on the ground
- ‚úÖ Adjustable splatter size, count, speed, and lifetime (GUI + parameters.json)
- ‚úÖ Adjustable fragment count, fragment lifetime, and melon respawn delay (GUI + parameters.json)
- ‚úÖ Ground plane for debris and splatter accumulation
- ‚úÖ Auto mode for continuous firing
- ‚úÖ All controls update simulation in real time
- ‚úÖ Logs track progress and pending features
