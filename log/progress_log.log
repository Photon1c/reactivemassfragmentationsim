=== RMF: Melon Protocol — Progress Log ===

[✔] Project initialized with Vite + Three.js
[✔] Modular file structure created (main.js, world.js, melon.js, ball.js, physics.js, effects.js)
[✔] Basic melon rendered using SphereGeometry
[✔] Projectile system implemented (mouse click spawns ball)
[✔] Basic collision detection with rupture threshold logic
[✔] Switched from fake motion to full Cannon.js rigidbody physics
[✔] Melon rupture now triggers on real impact velocity
[✔] Created dynamic splatter effect using random particle burst
[✔] Scaled splatter intensity based on impact velocity
[✔] Watermelon stripes and color now handled procedurally in Three.js (no Blender baking needed for base look)
[✔] Fully procedural watermelon with realistic skin, rind, and flesh
[✔] Fragments and seeds with robust physics, always accumulate on the ground
[✔] Adjustable splatter size, count, speed, and lifetime (GUI + parameters.json)
[✔] Adjustable fragment count, fragment lifetime, and melon respawn delay (GUI + parameters.json)
[✔] Ground plane for debris and splatter accumulation
[✔] Auto mode for continuous firing
[✔] All controls update simulation in real time
[✔] Strict ground boundary and improved gravity/drag for realistic fragment settling

🧪 Current Prototype Features:
- Fully modular, real-time projectile impact system
- Gravity-aware physics
- Splatter visuals (red juice droplets)
- Velocity-based rupture logic
- Real-time animated scene
- Realistic accumulation of fragments, seeds, and splatter on ground
- GUI for all major simulation parameters
- Auto mode and respawn delay

🚧 Backlog / Next Steps:
[ ] Decal splatter stains on impact surfaces
[ ] GUI: BURST THRESHOLD / RUPTURE MODE sliders
[ ] Add "Protocol Selector" for Pumpkin, Pineapple, etc.
[ ] Save GIF or video of rupture event
[ ] Optional: Sound FX and slow-motion replay
[⏸] Watermelon texture/material baking backlog (see pending.log)
