=== RMF: Melon Protocol — Pending/Backlog ===

[⏸] Watermelon texture/material baking backlog:
    - Procedural stripes and color are now handled in Three.js for the procedural and GLB models.
    - Blender baking workflow for stripes/cracks is only needed for future advanced models or more detailed textures.
    - Document the process for future model updates.
    - Investigate why baked images are black and resolve for future exports if needed.

[ ] Decal splatter stains on impact surfaces
[ ] Protocol selector for other fruits/vegetables
[ ] GIF/video export, sound FX, slow-motion replay (optional)

Note: All major simulation features (rupture, splatter, accumulation, GUI, respawn) are now implemented. Backlog is for advanced or optional features only.
